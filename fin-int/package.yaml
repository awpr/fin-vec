name: fin-int
version: 0.1.0.0
category: Data
synopsis: The type of finite sets with elements identified by the ordinals.
description: |
    This provides a newtype Fin containing an Int with an invariant that its
    value is less than its type-level Nat bound.  It aims to have low overhead
    compared to Ints, and is suitable for use as the index type of
    length-indexed vectors.
