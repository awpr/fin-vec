version: 0.1.0.0
category: Data
synopsis: A singleton type for `Nat` represented as `Int`.
description: |
    This package implements a type `SInt` that links a runtime `Int` with a
    type-level `Nat`, along with some arithmetic and reflection capabilities.

    This is useful when mixing type-level `Nat`s with GHC array primitives that
    expect `Int`s as sizes and indices.

    See the module intro of `Data.SInt` for more details.
